<!-- The $Pr=1$ dataset was originally reported by [Riley and de Bruyn Kops, PoF, 2003](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article-abstract/15/7/2047/255008/Dynamics-of-turbulence-strongly-influenced-by?redirectedFrom=fulltext). Through the INCITE program, these data have recently been extended to $Pr=7,50$, as reported in the analysis of [Petropoulous et al, JFM, 2025](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/modelling-dispersion-in-stratified-turbulent-flows-as-a-resetting-process/C9D566B4ABF95A35883CE4B213D947A9). -->

Evolution of the vertical derivative of density perturbations $\rho'_{z}$, scaled by the magnitude of the background density gradient <span>$$\left|\bar{\rho}_{z}\right|$$</span>, compared across simulations at Prandtl numbers $Pr=[1,7,50]$. Note that as $Pr$ increases, progressively finer detail is visible in the density field.
